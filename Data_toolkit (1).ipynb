        "Pandas allows easy date parsing, resampling, shifting, and frequency conversion.\n",
        "For example, you can quickly resample daily data to monthly averages with a single function call.\n",
        "It also supports time-based indexing, which allows filtering data by year, month, or even exact time stamps.\n",
        "Rolling window functions, like moving averages, are also built-in.\n",
        "Users can perform lag analysis and easily compare different time periods.\n",
        "Timezone handling and conversion between different time zones is supported.\n",
        "Integration with visualization libraries allows easy plotting of time series data.\n",

        "On the other hand, Python lists are objects that store references to elements scattered across memory.\n",
        "This difference in memory structure makes NumPy slicing much faster.\n",
        "NumPy uses vectorized operations that avoid explicit Python loops, reducing overhead.\n",
        "It returns a view of the original array (when possible), not a new copy, which saves time and memory.\n",
        "Python lists, in contrast, always create a new list when sliced.\n",

        "Because of this, NumPy slicing is closer to hardware-level operations.\n",
